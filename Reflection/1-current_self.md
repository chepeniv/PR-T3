## current knowledge and skills :

- what specific technical skills have you acquired or improved upon ?

the one technical skill i've developed that i'm most proud of is debugging.
aiding in this are my various mental models which have become more
sophisticated and accurate with practice. furthermore, i've become quite
comfortable using various tools which i initially found to be intimidating but
nonetheless essential in identifying problems with code.

- have you gained any practical experience through projects or internships

the most practical experience i believe i've acquired is being proficient with
git and using it to resolve various coordination problems. alongside, i've also
gotten pretty proficient in using the terminal to quickly and efficiently
navigate, manipulate, and find information in a linux machine.

## current thought process and mindset :

- how do you approach learning new concepts and technologies now compared
  to when you first began ?

the most notable thing i do different than when i first began is that i write a
a whole lot more prototypes to help me wrap my mind around new ideas. this helps
me answer my own questions without the aid of internet search engines. moreover,
it allows me to take my exploration of an idea or technology much further. the
thing that has remained consistent however is that i do like to keep source
documentation at hand to become familiar with it.

- have you developed any strategies or methods that help you grasp complex
  ideas more effectively ?

## specific meaningful experiences :

- are there any particular projects or assignments that have challenged you
  and helped you expand your skills ?

most recently, i worked on project that tasked us with creating a bash clone
which could be able to interpret, combine, and process various commands and
files. because of the various forms and functionality expected this was, in my
opinion, one of the most complex undertakings yet. getting all the various
behaviours to work well together while retaining memory-safety and code
comprehensibility was a rewarding challenge.

- how have these experiences shaped your understanding of software dev and
  your career aspirations ?

aspirationally, since i've gained familiarity with the way i work most
effectively, i hope to land a job with very flexible working hours, little
focus on social interaction, and a minimally overbearing bureaucracy.
that may be a big ask, but i hope that my work shows the benefit of just
letting me be.

## summary :

- share any insights or lessons learned from your current stage of the
  curriculum

one thing i cherish is the general non-technical life and work, advice and
feedback i've gotten from both instructors and fellow students. everyone here
has their own original insight into life and problems, and so it's helpful to
hear their takes on various issues. i'm glad that whenever i've come seeking
guidance from others their response and perspective has quite often been
helpful.

- reflect on how your thought processes and mindset have evolved
