# envision your future self -- reflection

- envision your future self
- set meaningful goals and aspirations
- create a roadmap
- motivate yourself to achieve your desired outcomes
- what skills do you aim to acquire
- what impact do you want to make
- how will you achieve this

## future self after completion:

**how do you envision your self applying these skills in real-world projects or
professional settings ?**

i hope to be part of some manufacturing or engineering endeavour. if so, i'd
like my role to be some sort of technician, whose tasked with maintenance and
development of digital systems. if things go wrong, i'd be the one called upon
to investigate and resolve the issue. furthermore, if new technical solutions
are desired i'd like to be relied upon to help develop such systems.

**what specific skills and knowledge do you aim to acquire during your time
here ?**

right now since i feel i'm lacking in my understanding and usage of
test-driven development, that's where i'd like to improve. another area, i see
i could develop further is in collaboration. this isn't a natural strength of
mine and i have little experience actually working with others, so i'd like to
become more of a natural at it. ultimately, however, i really want to just
deepen my expertise in algorithms, data structures, and operating systems.

## goals and aspirations:

**what specific career path or specialization are you interested in pursuing ?**

i'm very interested in robotics, manufacturing, and engineering. i'm drawn to
smaller scale fabrication operations, since i perceive them as more
accommodating and with a larger room to grow. here, i hope to become
indispensable -- to have an undeniable and crucial expertise.

## guiding values and principles:

i'm very interested in the dissemination of technological know-how, in the
democratization of technology itself, and the leveling of the economic playing
field against larger forces, if i'm upfront. to that end, i also see becoming
an educator myself as a viable option, but not one i'm too interested in.

**what steps will you take to ensure continuous learning and professional
development ?**

if i land a job that's not too demanding of my time i will most certainly
devote the remainder back into pursuing my personal research interest. since i
began at atlas i haven't had the time i used to, to just read and take notes on
other things that interest me. another thing i might aim to do is to convince
my employer that allowing employees to pursue their research interest when time
isn't too tight could benefit them with both innovation and talent retention.
baring that, i could just go straight into a research profession, but i see
that as a bit too pie-in-the-sky for me.

## summary:

**describe your envisioned future self after completing your education here**

i don't really know what will become of me. interesting things could happen, i
could remain stuck in my ways living more of the same, or i could just fade
back into obscurity, disappear, and wonder the earth again. it's six in the
morning; i've been up all night.
