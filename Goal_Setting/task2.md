# task 2

## where do you spend most of your time ?

most of my time is actually spent how i'd like, that is that what i think i
should be doing and what i'm actually doing are typically in alignment. however,
there are two areas which feel like sunk time. one is that i spend more time
than i'd like going down youtube rabbit-holes; the other is that, although i do
think that socializing is important, when i do engage in that, it often feels
like i could've utilized my time better. social interactions, if they're not
brief, tend to leave me feeling as though i got nothing out of them. perhaps
i need to find other friends which more closely align with my interest and
passions. it's rare that i feel a kinship connection with anyone.

## what is a thing you're NOT currently doing that if you did on a regular basis
## would make a huge positive difference for you ?

i need to carryout an end-of-day routine, wherein i do the dishes, tidy up, and
shower before going to bed. this is important because it means that i wont have
to waste my refresh cognitive capacity on mundane task and i can instead hit
the ground running on truly engaging goals when i wake up.

## what is one thing you could stop doing that would also make a positive
## difference ?

i need to stop relying on youtube to put me to sleep. the reason this is so
detrimental is that, if i'm not cautious enough i will end-up starting up the
next day in bed watching mindless nonsense on the internet. and that can leave
me with a bad taste in my mouth that lasts the whole day.

## what is something that you're currently doing that you believe is helpful and
## would like to continue ?

i do workout a bit in the mornings. this helps me wake up and feel better about
engaging with sedentary task later on in the day knowing that my body is taken
care off, and that i wont be bothered by some restless urge to lift or run.
moreover, i'm very consistent about handling other things in the morning, like
making my bed, and attending to my dogs, etc. taking care of these basic things
first frees my mind from cognitive clutter.

another thing that i'm very proud about is, that i'm very good about sitting
down and focusing for hours on end. i'm very persistent when it comes to
problem solving task. that, and i very much enjoy the cognitive stimulation.
i'm also very consistent about taking notes on, annotating, and cataloguing any
research material i encounter.

ironically, i'd say too, that starting slow (yet early) has proved to be a great
return on investment. putting in the effort just into the preparation stage
makes the execution stage much more of a breeze.
