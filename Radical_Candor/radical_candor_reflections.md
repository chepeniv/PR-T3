# Radical Candor Reflections

## 1. Radical Candor

when i was in construction, there were many instances when my bosses would give
me feedback on how to to perform tasks more effectively with safety always
being top of mind. not only that but since i was young my attitude wasn't
always in the right place and so they would let me know to pay mind to how
i was coming off and to value how other people feel. in the long run, i really
appreciate the direction they've helped mold my personality and the value of
going out of one's way to help others.

it was kind of uncomfortable being told i could be unlikable to others, but i
couldn't really object -- they were big burly men. nonetheless, they were kind
and straightforward and i could tell it came from a caring place.

## 2. Obnoxious Aggression

not that long ago i was hanging with a few friends and an acquaintance who was
being very confrontational and closed minded to others. after some people left
and he kept going on about the topic, i offered alternative perspectives. he
couldn't see it any other ways and kept insisting on his point of view and i
kept pointing out the pitfalls in his thinking. ultimately, after i told him
several times i didn't want to continue the conversation, i had to tell him
straight-up to stfu. he didn't like that, but i honestly didn't care about his
emotions. after this, seeing that the tensions were escalating and that i
didn't care what would happen next, he began to backtrack and defuse the
situation.

looking back i could've left earlier too along with everyone else. another,
thing i could've done as well is to press the escalation of the situation
further -- i really wouldn't've regretted that.
