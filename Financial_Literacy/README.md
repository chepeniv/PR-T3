# Financial Literacy

Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to equip students with essential financial
literacy skills by providing a hands-on approach to budgeting. By creating a
realistic monthly budget, students will learn how to allocate income
effectively, balance essential needs with discretionary spending, and prioritize
savings and debt repayment. This exercise aims to foster an understanding of how
financial decisions impact long-term financial health and goal achievement,
while also providing students with the practical tools to manage their personal
finances. Description

In this assignment, you will apply the principles of budgeting and financial
literacy by creating a detailed monthly budget based on one of the scenarios.
You will explore different budgeting methods and choose one that best fits your
financial preferences. The goal is to develop an understanding of how to
allocate income effectively, balance essential needs with discretionary
spending, and prioritize savings and debt repayment.

Here are several budgeting options you can consider, but you are welcome to
research and use another:

	The Zero-Based Budgeting Method: Every dollar of income is assigned a
	specific purpose, with the goal of “zeroing out” your budget. All your
	income is allocated to specific categories like spending, savings, and debt
	repayment, leaving no money unassigned. This method offers full control over
	each dollar. The Envelope System: For those who prefer a hands-on approach,
	the Envelope System involves allocating cash for each spending category.
	Once the money in an envelope is gone, you can’t spend any more in that
	category until the next budget period. This system helps you stick to limits
	and control your spending. The Balanced Money Formula: A variation of the
	50/30/20 rule, this method allocates 50% of your income to needs, 30% to
	wants, and 20% to savings. It offers a balanced approach that ensures your
	essentials are covered while still allowing room for enjoyment and financial
	growth. Proportional Budgeting: This approach allows you to divide your
	income into customized percentages based on your financial priorities. You
	can allocate a higher percentage to savings, debt repayment, or other
	categories depending on your specific goals.
