# ACADEMIC RESUME (FIRST DRAFT)

the purpose of this first draft is to showcase all education, aside from high
school, and experience you posses.

typically resumes are glanced for average of 6-7 seconds before a determination
is made to advance the candidate. for this reason, it is critical that a resume
clearly and concisely communicates your value proposition. any information that
is you may consider important but not relevant to the position at hand can be
expanded upon on one's personal profiles and websites.

here we will learn the seven core atlas resume standards which demonstrate key
elements that make a resume standout. the goal here is create a professional
resume that aligns to the expectations of recruiters.
