scenario:

	**update your team and project manager on the current project status**

	you're a junior dev working with a team adding a new feature to an existing
	web app. the feature involves adding a section to the user profile wherein
	customers can update their personal information. a small delay has been
	encountered due to unanticipated required changes to the database schema.
	the project manager asked for an update summarizing the current status of
	the implementation including what's completed, what's pending, and any
	challenges encountered. team members are relying on this update so that
	they can deduce the next steps, and the project manager will use it to
	adjust the timeline as needed.

	- design the user profile interface
	- implement frontend form elements for the user profile
	- set up backend logic to handle profile data submission
	- adjust the database schema to accommodate new profile fields
	- integrate API calls for fetching and updating user data
	- develop validation rules for user input on the profile form
	- write unit test for the new profile features
