scenario:

	**update your team and project manager on the current project status**

	you're a junior dev working with a team adding a new feature to an existing
	web app. the feature involves adding a section to the user profile wherein
	customers can update their personal information. a small delay has been
	encountered due to unanticipated required changes to the database schema.
	the project manager asked for an update summarizing the current status of
	the implementation including what's completed, what's pending, and any
	challenges encountered. team members are relying on this update so that
	they can deduce the next steps, and the project manager will use it to
	adjust the timeline as needed.

greeting:

	For all whom it may concern,

body:

	Before summarizing what has been accomplished thus far and what's well
	in-the-works, I want to address the primary issue encountered. There are
	changes that must be carried out in the database schema if we wish to fully
	deliver on this update. Obviously, our lead will have have the final say,
	but I propose that we rewrite the schema from the ground up and roll out the
	feature in chunks over the course of several weeks so as to not have to
	migrate our entire database all at once. This should be less risky and far
	more manageable. Regardless of the final call, I have sufficient elbow
	grease to see it through.

	All the easy stuff is out of the way. The basic layout and design of the
	interface is in place along with all the needed frontend elements. Moreover,
	in the prototype build, we have already setup the basic backend logic for
	data submission and input validation.

	Two of our other colleagues are handling the API-end of things and we're in
	constant communication. They intend to send out their own status update as
	well later on today.

	With regards to the unit test, one of my peers is guiding me through with
	that, thankfully. It's been a while since i've done them and I'm not yet
	fully familiar with internal standards, and so I'm not confident enough to
	do them on my own just yet. In any case, this is what I will be focusing on
	until I get a word on our leads final decision.
