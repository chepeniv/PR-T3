scenario:

	**address a bug report submitted by a colleague, where you suspect user
	error rather than an actual code issue**

	you're an entry-level dev working with a team testing a new feature for an
	internal company tool. a colleague from QA has reported a bug, stating that
	the tool isn't saving user settings correctly. after reviewing the report,
	you suspect the issue might not be the code itself but rather possibly a
	misunderstanding about how the settings are supposed to be used. reply
	explaining your findings, suggesting they retry testing the feature with
	specific instructions, and offer help if the issue persist
