# Subject Line

Requesting Clarification for Feedback Form Fields and Data Handling

# Body

John Doe (Team Lead),

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that I was tasked with creating the feedback form, and few details
where given, I was wondering a few things about which fields to include,
what rules for each, and where to sendoff or store the data.  I also have a
question or two about the form's overall context. Is there some
documentation I missed?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at how various other websites have done it, and I have come up with
few ideas; I even have a preliminary prototype, but I wanted to verify with
you on what the end-result should be.

I present my inquiries chronologically here:

- Should the visitor already be logged in?
- Which fields should be required?
- Should we mandate they select a category (corresponding to our various
  departments and teams)
	- for example, "product review" could be sent to marketing, "feature
	  request" could be sent to the development team, "bugs" to QA, etc.
- Once the form is submitted where should it go?
	- Is there already a predefined destination?
	- Should I create a new internal database?
		- Who should manage it, who can access it?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I could automate internal emails that would notify the relevant
unit about feedback they could take a look at.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall how should this new feature fit into the current way we do things?
Am I over-extending something that should be simpler and more
straightforward here?
