# Tasks

- [ ] update READMEs

## Questions

- since we're only doing PR, what will be the hours for PLDs ?
- will we have to completely remake previously completed projects or will
  updating and modifying be enough for those ?
- how soon can we complete the InStage interviews or any task for that mater ?
