# Reflect

	Reflect on the feedback you received and the themes that were portrayed
	throughout the results. Write a brief reflection using the questions below.
	Choose 3 questions from the following list to answer. Write at least 3
	sentences for each reflection question. Answer at least 3 questions with at
	least 3 sentences written as a reflection to each question.

Reflection questions to get you thinking:

	What strengths came up often in the responses you received? Were those the
	responses you expected? What strengths did others identify in you that you
	wouldn’t have identified in yourself? What strengths did others not identify
	that you would consider your strengths? How do your strengths align with the
	skills you want to build in the next year? In what ways could you apply
	these strengths to your future career?

Finally, once you’ve taken time to reflect on your answers the most important
step of the process begins!

This is your time to find ways to apply what you’ve learned about yourself in
your personal life, your life at Atlas, and as you approach your career in
technology.
