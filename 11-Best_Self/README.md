# Purpose

Each of us can create a list of strengths we believe we have. However, there are
many strengths we hold that are more apparent to the people we work, live, and
socialize with often. The purpose of this project is to gather data about what
others see in us when we show up as our “best self” in order to better
understand the strengths we possess. This, in turn, will help us better brand
ourselves to employers when we are seeking new opportunities and determine what
roles we may succeed in. It will also prepare you to speak about yourself in a
positive manner. We are often told to be humble and not overzealous when it
comes to our personalities, this project is giving you outside data in order to
evaluate yourself.

This project will help you in T4 when we create your Personal Narrative. We are
determining who you are as a professional in this new industry. You should also
be able to create your elevator pitch which will aid you in networking,
interviewing, and job applications.
