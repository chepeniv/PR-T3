# Purpose

there are strengths we hold that are more apparent to others than they are to
us. here we'll gather data about what others see in us as our primary strengths.
this will help us better brand ourselves and to determine what roles may best be
suited for. it will enable you to present yourself in a positive manner.

we'll determine who you are as a professional. this will aid you later when you
create an elevator pitch
