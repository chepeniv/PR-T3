# Scenario Description

**Update team and project manager on the current project status**

```
you're a junior dev working with a team adding a new feature to an existing
web app. the feature involves adding a section to the user profile wherein
customers can update their personal information. a small delay has been
encountered due to unanticipated required changes to the database schema.
the project manager asked for an update summarizing the current status of
the implementation including what's completed, what's pending, and any
challenges encountered. team members are relying on this update so that
they can deduce the next steps, and the project manager will use it to
adjust the timeline as needed.
```

# Subject Line

Progress Implementing a Personal Information Section for User Profiles

# Body

For all whom it may concern,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before summarizing what has been accomplished thus far and what's well
in-the-works, I want to address the primary issue encountered. There are
changes that must be carried out in the database schema if we wish to fully
deliver on this update. Obviously, our lead will have have the final say,
but I propose that we rewrite the schema from the ground up and roll out the
feature in chunks over the course of several weeks so as to not have to
migrate our entire database all at once. This should be less risky and far
more manageable. Regardless of the final call, I have sufficient elbow
grease to see it through.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the easy stuff is out of the way. The basic layout and design of the
interface is in place along with all the needed frontend elements. Moreover,
in the prototype build, we have already setup the basic backend logic for
data submission and input validation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of our other colleagues are handling the API-end of things and we're in
constant communication. They intend to send out their own status update as
well, later on today.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to the unit test, one of my peers is guiding me through with
that, thankfully. It's been a while since I've done them and I'm not yet
fully familiar with internal standards, and so I'm not confident enough to
do them on my own just yet. In any case, this is what I will be focusing on
until I get a word on our leads final decision.
