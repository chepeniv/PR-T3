# Scenario Description

**Update team and project manager on the current project status**

```
you're a junior dev working with a team adding a new feature to an existing
web app. the feature involves adding a section to the user profile wherein
customers can update their personal information. a small delay has been
encountered due to unanticipated required changes to the database schema.
the project manager asked for an update summarizing the current status of
the implementation including what's completed, what's pending, and any
challenges encountered. team members are relying on this update so that
they can deduce the next steps, and the project manager will use it to
adjust the timeline as needed.
