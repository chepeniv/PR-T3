# Description

- address each scenario professionally
- send each crafted email to the instructor
- upload a screenshot to the project page

## Scenario 1

**update your team and project manager on the current project status**

you're a junior dev working with a team adding a new feature to an existing web
app. the feature involves adding a section to the user profile wherein
customers can update their personal information. a small delay has been
encountered due to unanticipated required changes to the database schema. the
project manager asked for an update summarizing the current status of the
implementation including what's completed, what's pending, and any challenges
encountered. team members are relying on this update so that they can deduce
the next steps, and the project manager will use it to adjust the timeline as
needed.

### Potential Tasks

- design the user profile interface
- implement frontend form elements for the user profile
- set up backend logic to handle profile data submission
- adjust the database schema to accommodate new profile fields
- integrate API calls for fetching and updating user data
- develop validation rules for user input on the profile form
- write unit test for the new profile features

## Scenario 2

**address a bug report submitted by a colleage, where you suspect user error
rather than an actual code issue**

you're an entry-level dev working with a team testing a new feature for an
internal company tool. a colleague from QA has reported a bug, stating that the
tool isn't saving user settings correctly. after reviewing the report, you
suspect the issue might not be the code itself but rather possibly a
misunderstanding about how the settings are supposed to be used. reply
explaining your findings, suggesting they retry testing the feature with
specific instructions, and offer help if the issue persist

## Scenario 3

**request clarification on task requirements from your team lead**

you're an entry-level software engineer assigned to develop a small feature for
a web app your team is working on. it involves implementing a new form wherein
users can submit feedback. however, the task description provided by the lead is
a bit vague, and you're not sure what fields the forms should include or how the
data should be handled. request clarification from the lead on the specific
requirements so that you may proceed with confidence
