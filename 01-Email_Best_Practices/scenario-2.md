# Scenario Description

**Address a bug report submitted by a colleague, where you suspect user
error rather than an actual code issue**

```
you're an entry-level dev working with a team testing a new feature for an
internal company tool. a colleague from QA has reported a bug, stating that
the tool isn't saving user settings correctly. after reviewing the report,
you suspect the issue might not be the code itself but rather possibly a
misunderstanding about how the settings are supposed to be used. reply
explaining your findings, suggesting they retry testing the feature with
specific instructions, and offer help if the issue persist
```

# Subject Line:

RE: Bug Report â€“ User Settings Not Saving

# Body:

Dear John Doe,

i reviewed the feature behavior and current implementation, and i believe the
tool is functioning as expected.

settings only persist after the "save" button has been clicked. if settings are
adjusted and the page is refreshed without saving then the changes will not
take effect.

try this:

- adjust whatever user setting you'd like
- click the "save" button
- refresh or navigate away and then return to confirm the persistence of changes

if you have already followed these steps and the issue persists, let me
know. i can investigate further or jump on a call with you to further identify
the problem
