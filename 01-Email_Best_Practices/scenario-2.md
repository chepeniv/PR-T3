# Scenario Description

**Address a bug report submitted by a colleague, where you suspect user
error rather than an actual code issue**

```
you're an entry-level dev working with a team testing a new feature for an
internal company tool. a colleague from QA has reported a bug, stating that
the tool isn't saving user settings correctly. after reviewing the report,
you suspect the issue might not be the code itself but rather possibly a
misunderstanding about how the settings are supposed to be used. reply
explaining your findings, suggesting they retry testing the feature with
specific instructions, and offer help if the issue persist
```
