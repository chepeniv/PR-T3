## rough draft

<!--
former street kid. i enjoy and respect manual labor and artisan crafts. i have
been many people and see my self as been well rounded and integrated.

because the chaos i grew up in has undermined so much of what i've strived for,
i had to transform my life into a safe-heaven of stability in order to make any
progress whatsoever.
