## budgeting options to consider

- the zero-based budgeting method: every dollar of income is assigned a specific
  purpose, with the goal of “zeroing out” your budget. all your income is
  allocated to specific categories like spending, savings, and debt repayment,
  leaving no money unassigned. this method offers full control over each dollar
- the envelope system: for those who prefer a hands-on approach, the envelope
  system involves allocating cash for each spending category. once the money in
  an envelope is gone, you can’t spend any more in that category until the next
  budget period. this system helps you stick to limits and control your spending
- the balanced money formula: a variation of the 50/30/20 rule, this method
  allocates 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. it
  offers a balanced approach that ensures your essentials are covered while
  still allowing room for enjoyment and financial growth
- proportional budgeting: allows you to divide your income into customized
  percentages based on your financial priorities. you can allocate a higher
  percentage to savings, debt repayment, or other categories depending on your
  specific goals.
