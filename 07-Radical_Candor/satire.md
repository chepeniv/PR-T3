# "The Enlightenment of Greg"

It all started in the break room, as these things often do. Greg had the audacity to take the last oat milk from the communal fridge. Now, ordinarily, I wouldn’t bat an eye. I’m a software engineer, a sound engineer, a composer, a writer, and a researcher — I don't need oat milk to validate my existence. But this oat milk, this specific oat milk, was the emotional centerpiece of my new morning routine, which I’d developed during a weekend-long Inner Excellence™ workshop titled "Yes, You Can (And Should)".

So I approached Greg with poise. “Hey man,” I said, my voice tempered by three years of intermittent meditation. “Did you happen to see my name on the oat milk?”

He smirked. Smirked. And replied, “Must’ve missed it.”

That’s when I knew: this was no ordinary interpersonal conflict. This was my test. A trial sent by the universe (or perhaps facilitated by the workshop’s charismatic founder, Kyle, who once hugged me so hard I saw my past lives).

I recalled Kyle’s teachings: “When someone wrongs you, they’re gifting you an opportunity for growth. And possibly a lawsuit.” So I took a breath, summoned the lessons of Module Four: Emotional Jiu-Jitsu for Tech Professionals, and replied:

“Greg, I want you to know that your behavior is a mirror for my own unresolved childhood dynamics. And I forgive you.”

He blinked.

I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. The room had become sacred.

“I see now that the oat milk was never the problem. You were never the problem. I was addicted to being right. And now, I transcend.”

At this point, several coworkers had gathered. Some were pretending to microwave things just to stay.

Greg chuckled awkwardly and said, “Okay, man. I’ll buy you a new one.”

But that wasn’t the point. That would be winning. I didn’t want to win. I wanted to awaken. So I placed my hand gently on his shoulder, stared deep into his eyes, and whispered: “I free you.”

That’s when Sharon from HR clapped. Actual applause. And then, somehow, a talking falcon flew in through the open skylight and perched on the fridge, nodding in approval. I don’t know whose falcon it was, but its presence felt... timely.

Later that day, I was promoted. Not to any specific title — just universally. Promoted as a being. Greg quit and moved to Sedona to find himself. And I? I began teaching my own workshop: "Sipping the Self: Liquid Mindfulness and the Corporate Soul." Enrollment’s already full.

And the best part? I never even liked oat milk.

# "Return of the Oat Prophet: The Grégoire Ascension"

It was a year to the day since The Incident — the Great Oat Milk Awakening that had changed my life, Greg’s life, and arguably the entire break room dynamic on Floor 3. I had moved on. My workshop Sipping the Self had expanded into a lifestyle brand. We were in talks with Netflix for a 12-part docuseries entitled Brewed for Greatness. I had a spiritual assistant named Brienna who only communicated through chimes.

Then, one afternoon during my Lunchfast™ (a meal designed to confuse your body into releasing serotonin), the conference room door swung open.

He walked in barefoot.

White linen.

Man bun like a swan’s nest.

A subtle smell of palo santo, shame, and expensive nut butter.

“Hello... old friend,” he said, drawing out the ellipsis like it was a part of his soul.

“Greg?” I asked, though I knew better.

He smiled. “It’s Grégoire now. Two accents. One on the é. One on your heart.”

Someone in the room gasped. Or choked. It was unclear.

“I’ve come not for revenge,” he continued, circling me slowly, “but to co-create. After my departure, I journeyed inward. And then outward. Mostly to Bali, but also parts of Arizona. I was taken in by a group of digital shamans and drop-shipped enlightenment coaches. I saw things. Hashtags. Brand synergy. The divine Google Sheet.”

He paused by the window and stared out dramatically. “And now... I return. To merge with you.”

I blinked. “Merge?”

“Yes. You represent the inner sip. I am the outer gulp. Together, we are Hydration Actualized™.”

I tried to resist. I reminded him of his crimes — the oat milk, the smirk, the disrespect of my laminated fridge labels. But Grégoire was beyond consequences now. He floated when he walked. He spoke exclusively in uppercase concepts: ALIGNMENT, ENERGETIC SCALABILITY, VIBRATIONAL REBRANDING.

By Friday, our joint workshop, Milk the Infinite: How to Drink Your Truth, had sold out in three time zones.

And just like that, we were whole again.

But make no mistake — I still never trusted him around my beverages.
