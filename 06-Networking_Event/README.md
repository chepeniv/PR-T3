# Attend a Networking Event

finding events :

- search online or ask professionals
	- look for conferences hosted or attended by companies your interest in
	- find professional organizations and nonprofits aligned with your interest
	- look for social calendars that share community events
	- keep an eye on the Atlas staff roundup

attending events :

- pair up with an outgoing friend, if nervous or introverted, who can initiate
  and integrate you into conversations
- be ready to answer "tell me about yourself" and have a short-and-sweet
  introduction prepared which lays out your past, present, and future
- have engaging first questions at the ready - [networking questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/questions-to-ask-at-a-networking-event)
- have follow-ups prepared for anyone you meet, such as exchanging business
  cards or using qr codes. follow through by messaging them acknowledging your
  interaction and follow up any tentative plans
